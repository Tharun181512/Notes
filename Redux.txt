-> Redux is an predicatble state container for Javascript applications.
-> It is used commonly used with React, but it can be use with any other javascript framwork(or) library.
     There are three types of Applications.
	  -> State
	  -> Store
	  -> Action 
	  
-> Pacakges required to use redux
npm install redux - it is only used for redux software.
npm install react-redux - it is only used for react + redux.
npm install redux-thunk
npm install redux-devtools-extension - it is only used for extension web.

Major terms we use in redux: 
-> Actions, reducer, store.

React-Redux : 
-> redcat-redux is a library that provides blindings b/w React,redux helping you integrate the two seamlessly.
Why will we use react-redux : 
-> connect react components to the redux store.
-> access to redux store state.
-> dispatch actions.
-> efficient rendering.
-> selector functions.
-> provider component.
-> integration with react hooks.
-> centralized state management.

Redux-thunk :
Redux-thunk is a middleware for redux, a popular state management library in the react eco-system. 
it is used to handle asynchronus operations in redux applications.
Why will we use Redux-thunk :
-> handling asynchronus actions.
-> side effects.
-> seperation of concerns.
-> access to dispatch & getstate.
-> conditional dispatch.
-> easier testing.

Redux-DevTools-Extension :
redux-devtools-extension is a browser extension that enhances the developement experience when working with redux.
It provides a set of tools and features of debugging,inspecting, & time-travelling through your redux state.
Why will we use Redux-DevTools-Extension :
-> state inspection.
-> time-travel Debugging.
-> action logging.
-> redux devtools ui.
-> integration with middleware.
-> export & import state.
-> performance monitoring.
-> cross-browser support.






Differences betweeen Old Redux & Redux Toolkit 


             Old Redux                                                                                Redux-Toolkit
		https://redux.js.org                                                                   https://redux-toolkit.js.org
	-> You have to configure redux devtool Extension Explicity.                            -> It provides automatic support for redux devtools extension.
	-> We need to manually handle and change the state immutably.                          -> It provides the immer.js library which automatically changes the code immutably.
	-> Configuring a redux store is to complicated.                                        -> Configuring a redux store is much easier and built in support of middleware.
	-> need to create reducess & creators seperately-lots of boilplater code.              -> A createSlice() function that comes in hand to replace create action & creater reducer function with a single function.
	-> lots of code need to write to handle asynchronic nows request & handling            -> create asyncthunk to make asynchronous requests.
	   error code was also manual.  
    -> class based implementation.                                                         -> functional implementation with typescript and supports of hooks.
